        "*Events* are subsets of the sample space.\n",
        "For instance, the event \"the first coin toss comes up heads\"\n",
        "corresponds to the set $\\{(\\textrm{heads}, \\textrm{heads}), (\\textrm{heads}, \\textrm{tails})\\}$.\n",
        "Whenever the outcome $z$ of a random experiment satisfies\n",
        "$z \\in \\mathcal{A}$, then event $\\mathcal{A}$ has occurred.\n",
        "For a single roll of a die, we could define the events\n",

        "In this case, if the die came up $5$,\n",

        "A *probability* function maps events\n",
        "onto real values ${P: \\mathcal{A} \\subseteq \\mathcal{S} \\rightarrow [0,1]}$.\n",
        "The probability, denoted $P(\\mathcal{A})$, of an event $\\mathcal{A}$\n",
        "in the given sample space $\\mathcal{S}$,\n",
        "has the following properties:\n",
        "\n",
        "* The probability of any event $\\mathcal{A}$ is a nonnegative real number, i.e., $P(\\mathcal{A}) \\geq 0$;\n",
        "* The probability of the entire sample space is $1$, i.e., $P(\\mathcal{S}) = 1$;\n",
        "* For any countable sequence of events $\\mathcal{A}_1, \\mathcal{A}_2, \\ldots$ that are *mutually exclusive* (i.e., $\\mathcal{A}_i \\cap \\mathcal{A}_j = \\emptyset$ for all $i \\neq j$), the probability that any of them happens is equal to the sum of their individual probabilities, i.e., $P(\\bigcup_{i=1}^{\\infty} \\mathcal{A}_i) = \\sum_{i=1}^{\\infty} P(\\mathcal{A}_i)$.\n",
        "\n",
        "These axioms of probability theory,\n",
        "proposed by :citet:`Kolmogorov.1933`,\n",
        "can be applied to rapidly derive a number of important consequences.\n",
        "For instance, it follows immediately\n",
        "that the probability of any event $\\mathcal{A}$\n",
        "*or* its complement $\\mathcal{A}'$ occurring is 1\n",
        "(because $\\mathcal{A} \\cup \\mathcal{A}' = \\mathcal{S}$).\n",
        "We can also prove that $P(\\emptyset) = 0$\n",
        "because $1 = P(\\mathcal{S} \\cup \\mathcal{S}') = P(\\mathcal{S} \\cup \\emptyset) = P(\\mathcal{S}) + P(\\emptyset) = 1 + P(\\emptyset)$.\n",
        "Consequently, the probability of any event $\\mathcal{A}$\n",
        "*and* its complement $\\mathcal{A}'$ occurring simultaneously\n",
        "is $P(\\mathcal{A} \\cap \\mathcal{A}') = 0$.\n",

        "## Random Variables\n",
        "\n",
        "When we spoke about events like the roll of a die\n",
        "coming up odds or the first coin toss coming up heads,\n",
        "we were invoking the idea of a *random variable*.\n",
        "Formally, random variables are mappings\n",
        "from an underlying sample space\n",
        "to a set of (possibly many) values.\n",
        "You might wonder how a random variable\n",
        "is different from the sample space,\n",
        "since both are collections of outcomes.\n",
        "Importantly, random variables can be much coarser\n",
        "than the raw sample space.\n",
        "We can define a binary random variable like \"greater than 0.5\"\n",
        "even when the underlying sample space is infinite,\n",
        "e.g., points on the line segment between $0$ and $1$.\n",
        "Additionally, multiple random variables\n",
        "can share the same underlying sample space.\n",
        "For example \"whether my home alarm goes off\"\n",
        "and \"whether my house was burgled\"\n",
        "are both binary random variables\n",
        "that share an underlying sample space.\n",
        "Consequently, knowing the value taken by one random variable\n",
        "can tell us something about the likely value of another random variable.\n",
        "Knowing that the alarm went off,\n",
        "we might suspect that the house was likely burgled.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Every value taken by a random variable corresponds\n",
        "to a subset of the underlying sample space.\n",
        "Thus the occurrence where the random variable $X$\n",
        "takes value $v$, denoted by $X=v$, is an *event*\n",
        "and $P(X=v)$ denotes its probability.\n",
        "Sometimes this notation can get clunky,\n",
        "and we can abuse notation when the context is clear.\n",
        "For example, we might use $P(X)$ to refer broadly\n",
        "to the *distribution* of $X$, i.e.,\n",
